
## Simple Improvements I Made
I implemented several improvements, including developing a GET request to verify that the record was indeed saved in the database.

I created unit tests to validate the newly developed functions.

I enhanced the frontend screen interaction.

## Feedback
This challenge was very demanding, and I believe I gained a significant amount of knowledge from it. It demonstrates my passion for technology and my drive to continually learn and understand how things work. This was the best I could achieve within a short timeframe.

## Future Improvements
Looking forward, I believe I could have structured and created more scenarios to validate the E2E process, such as validating the "shutdown" button, implementing more actions on the screen for frontend validation, and improving the Docker setup to run E2E tests more efficiently.
