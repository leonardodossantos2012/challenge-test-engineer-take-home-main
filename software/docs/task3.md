# Debugging and Reliability Enhancement
The non-deterministic nature of CameraMock under low-lighting conditions significantly impacts the reliability of AISystemMock. By introducing deterministic behavior during testing through seeding, adjusting detection thresholds, and implementing preprocessing steps, the reliability of the AI system can be improved. Documenting these findings helps in understanding the limitations and guiding further improvements in the system.
